I have developed a movies information web application using React, Redux, and SCSS. The application fetches data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API to provide comprehensive details about movies. By utilizing React, I built a responsive and interactive user interface that allows users to search for movies, view their details, and explore related information.
The Redux library was incorporated to manage the application's state, enabling efficient data handling and seamless updates across different components. With Redux, I ensured a centralized data flow and implemented actions and reducers to handle user interactions and API requests.
